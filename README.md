Data Description

Shape Data

Defined in src/shape/Shape.py , the Shape  class represents a 3D object as a weighted
undirected graph.

Attributes:

name : The name of the shape.
dm : Distance matrix (numpy array of shape (200, 200)).
coordinates : 3D coordinates of each point of the shape (numpy array of shape (3, 200)).
dgms : Vietorisâ€“Rips diagram of dimension 0, 1, 2.
diameter : The diameter of the shape.

Example Usage:

Shape Methods

Shape.save_to_mat(path) : Exports the shape to a file at the specified path .
load_from_mat(path) : Loads a shape object from a .mat  file at the given path .

Distance Matrix

Distance matrices are stored as .csv  files in the data/distance_matrix/  folder. Each file is
a 2D array of shape (200,200), where each element (i, j) represents the pairwise distance
between the i-th and j-th shapes. Shapes are sorted alphabetically from a to z.

class Shape:
    def __init__(self, name, dm, coordinates=None):
        """
        Initializes a Shape object.

        Args:
            name (str): Name of the shape.
            dm (numpy.array): Distance matrix of the shape.
            coordinates (numpy.array, optional): Coordinates of the shape. 
Defaults to None.
        """

shape1 = Shape("cat0", dm, coords)
print(shape1.dm)

Usage

dependencies

0. Install the dependencies. The dependencies are in the first cell of the main.ipynb.
1. Run preprocess.py  inside the script, you need to properly set the path to nonrigid3d data

folder.
2. Run main.ipynb. before running all scripts, set the variables for paths to preprocessed

geodesic and euclidean data. (in the second code cell.)
